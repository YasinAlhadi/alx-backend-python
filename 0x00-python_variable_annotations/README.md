# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
0. Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.<br />
1. Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.<br />
2. Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.<br />
3. Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.<br />
4. <p>Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a</code>, an integer with a value of 1</li>
<li><code>pi</code>, a float with a value of 3.14</li>
<li><code>i_understand_annotations</code>, a boolean with a value of True</li>
<li><code>school</code>, a string with a value of “Holberton”</li>
</ul>
5. Write a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.<br />
6. Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of floats and integers and returns their sum as a float.<br />
7Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.<br />
8. Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.<br />
9. Let's duck type an iterable object. Annotate the below function’s parameters and return values with the appropriate types
